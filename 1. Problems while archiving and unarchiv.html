1. Problems while archiving and unarchiving the group-channels
=======================================================================
If there is only one group-channel and you attempt to archive it, then there is an error in some reducer file.

I am using the following channel method to archive or unarchive:
==================================================================

const archiveChannel = async () => {
  await currentChannel.hide(false, false);
}

const unarchiveChannel = async () => {
  await currentChannel.unhide()
}


Description of an error: 
===============================
reducers.js:138 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'url')
    at reducer (reducers.js:138:1)
    at updateReducer (react-dom.development.js:16664:1)
    at Object.useReducer (react-dom.development.js:17898:1)
    at useReducer (react.development.js:1626:1)

    at performUnitOfWork (react-dom.development.js:26557:1) 


P.S : But, if there are more than one group-channels then archiving/unarchiving happens without any error
    untill the last one. Then for the last one, the same error occurs again.

2. We want to delete a message from a channel for a perticular user only. But others users in the channel 
   should still be able to see that deleted message of a perticular user.
   But, currently if a user deletes its message from a channel, it is deleted for all users in the channel.
